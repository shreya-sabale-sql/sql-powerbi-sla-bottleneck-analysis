# sql-powerbi-sla-bottleneck-analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes IT ticket lifecycle data using SQL and Power BI to identify SLA breaches, operational bottlenecks, and team capacity issues. The goal is to move beyond reporting and enable data-driven operational decision-making.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem
IT organizations often miss SLAs due to dependency-driven delays, uneven workload distribution, and lack of visibility into process-level inefficiencies. This project addresses these challenges using process analytics.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills
- SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Time-based analysis)
- PostgreSQL
- Power BI (DAX, Interactive Dashboards)
- Process Analytics & SLA Governance

## 📊 Dashboard Pages
1. Executive Overview  
2. SLA & Bottleneck Deep Dive  
3. Team & Capacity Analysis  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- The Waiting stage contributes the highest share of total resolution time  
- SLA breaches are driven more by process dependencies than execution speed  
- A small subset of tickets accounts for a majority of delays  
- Team capacity imbalance worsens SLA performance  

---

## 🚀 Recommendations
- Reduce dependency-related waiting times  
- Escalate repeat SLA breachers  
- Rebalance workload across teams instead of blanket hiring
